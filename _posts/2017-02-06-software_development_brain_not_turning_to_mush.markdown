After 10 weeks of maternity leave, I decided to quit my job as a Project Manager at a marketing agency. I enjoyed what I did, but I knew I had a hard time leaving work at a reasonable time, especially when we were busy (which was 85% of the time). I loved being home with my daughter and seeing all her 'firsts.' But, as anyone who has been home with a baby for an extended period can tell you, I was feeling lonely, but never alone; busy, but unaccomplished. I missed my colleagues, problem solving, and feeling like I was contributing. I started taking some Lynda.com courses on development. I completed a couple, but dropped off as the holidays started taking my attention. 

Shortly after Christmas, I received an email about Birchbox's 'Women Take Tech' scholarship. After researching the scholarship and the Flatiron School. I started the Bootcamp Prep course. Upon hearing that I was being awarded the scholarship, I decided to go for it. I'm not positive that I will want to be a software developer for the rest of my life, or even when I finish the program. But, I feel it's an important skill to have and will provide me with new options when I do return to work.
